# Other considerations

 There are of course however, not obvious considerations to factor into the code and what has been discussed in https://github.com/RussC-Xer0n3/QBit-and-Gparticulates/blob/main/QuBits_GParticulates.pdf a subsequent loose write up of the code.
 
 There are considerations of gravity and magnetic fields in EMP and EMF which have not been factored in.
 
 The shear scale of all variables and very few real constants in the universe and the space time continuum.
 
 Scale itself is one other such consideration given the magnitude of scale in it's miniscule and grandure.

 Mass and Meta or as I like to call them Mother nature and Om respectively.
 
 There are also and quite fundamentaly even though time is a vast constant, considerations of where you are in that constant relative to space time.
 
 One desireable consideration is a use case of, of course, travel or 'transcendence' through space time and ability to use such knowledge for predictions and calculations in space travel.
