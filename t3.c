Get current time relative to space for all vectors of distribution from point A (time1 + Nlocations)
Get time delay difference between point A and (time 2 + Nlocations) by subtracting the mean average cubed from time1 and time2 - gives time taken from all distribution points to all collection points as mean average cubed
quantify actual data relative to arrival times after ditribution should give a 3d representation of our exact location in the universe. calculate distance over time for velocity of unique signal.

Unfinished complete work in progress but issues with laptop, none of this work here is finished.

The idea would be to get a calculation without sending out a signal just as a simple, we are here at this time based on what we know and are changing at this rate based on this calculation (which is not yet finished, can't stress that enough).
